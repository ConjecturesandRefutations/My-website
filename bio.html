<p id="bio">My name is Alfie Collins. I have a varied academic background. First, I did a degree in philosophy at the University of York. Then, I did a masters degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge. I then did a Graduate Diploma in Law from the University of Law. Now, my passion is coding and I am partaking in a web-development 'bootcamp'. My extra-curricular hobbies include running, meditating and painting.</p>
